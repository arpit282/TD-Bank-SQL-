- b) Feed-2 which has 15 columns with 15 rows,

- c) Feed-3 which has 20 columns with 20 rows

Automate the Req 1 input file generation using SQL scripts and the parameter will be "Feed name" & Number of Rows to populate Data

**Req 3:**
Write SQL script to identify the duplicate (rows) in each of the table Feed-1, 2, 3

**Req 4:**
Write the duplicate records in output file - "duplicates"

**Req 5:**
Create a script to replace all the duplicates with Unique rows and update back to respective Feed table

**Req 6:**
Execute the duplicate script and check the output is zero

**Req 7:**
Create SQL script to compare data from Feed-2,3 to Feed-1 and write in output file on the compared results

**Req 8:**
Create Test plan with all kinds of manual test cases in order to test this End to End functionality

**Req 9:**
Automate the test cases (if possible) using any method but should be automated...
